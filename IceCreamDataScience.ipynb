Here, the corresponding .csv file was downloaded and will be used from local repository. This file contains list of all locations which have status of city, along with Postal Code and Population data. \n\nAdditionally, since the data file from Statistisches Bundesamt has only one Postal Code per city, but the large cities as Berlin or Hamburg have many Postal Codes, additional database with __all__ postal codes as well as with latitude and longitude coordinates was downloaded from https://github.com/zauberware/postal-codes-json-xml-csv for Germany.\n\n__The information about current Ice Cream Shops__ will be retrieved from ForeSquares.com API based on coordinates of the cities from above databases. \n\n"
